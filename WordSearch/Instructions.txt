This word search game randomly fits 10 words from a english or spanish dictionary 
on a 15 by 15 grid.  Words can be placed either forwards or reverse in a horizontal, 
vertical or diagonal orientation. To make a guess left click at each end of the word.  
The selection text colour is yellow. If the guess is correct the colour will change to 
light blue on the grid and word list to show found words. If you want to use an alternate 
word dictionary just replace the dictionary file in words directory.  The format of the file 
is one row for each word and two entries for each word.  This is because, the game can be used 
to practice a foreign language and so the first entry would be the word to search in the grid and 
the second would be the word displayed in the list
